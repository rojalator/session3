[6/20/05] MO
  - Release 0.5; adjust MySQLSessionStore and DirectorySessionStore for Python
    2.3 compatibility, and to accept either a string or array.array('c') type
    from MySQL.

[6/17/05] MO
  - Release 0.4; MySQLSessionStore uses pickle protocol 2 and saves it in a
    BLOB column; strategy contributed by Damjan.  This allows better pickling
    of new-style classes and gets around a charset feature in MySQL 4.1.
    Users need to convert the 'pickle' column in their sessions table to type
    BLOB, or delete the table and recreate it.

  - DirectorySessionStore uses pickle protocol 2.  Existing sessions will
    automatically be updated.

  - Note: the only other store using pickle is PostgresSessionStore.  It's
    still using pickle protocol 0.

[6/15/05] MO
  - Release 0.3; typo in Makefile.

[6/14/05] MO
  - Release 0.2; fix bug in setup.py

[6/12/05] CTB
  - Release 0.1; first for public consumption.
