Automated testing of session2
-----------------------------

The directory 'twill-tests' contains several tests that verify the
behavior of 'test_session2.py'.  To run them, you need to install
twill_ and nose_.  Then just execute 'nosetests' in the top directory.

You can also just run 'test_session2.py' with no command-line arguments
for help.

The tests do not test persistence or multithreading yet.
